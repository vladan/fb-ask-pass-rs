[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gdamjan/fb-ask-pass-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gdamjan/fb-ask-pass-rs)


Primary usage: run it from a initcpio hook (on archlinux) to ask for the LUKS passphrase, while showing the firmware picture.
The passphrase is saved in a file (`/crypto_keyfile.bin`) which the `encrypt` hook uses to unlock LUKS volumes.

The kernel parameters I use are:
`quiet udev.log_priority=3 loglevel=3 vt.global_cursor_default=0 i915.fastboot=1`


For testing, in a console you can just run:

```
sudo chown `id -u` /dev/fb0
cargo run
```

and it'll show whatever you type on the terminal. It won't work in X11 or wayland.

# FAQ

## Why Rust?

- It's a learning experience
- Rust compiles to a single binary, depends only on glibc


## How does it work?

- the program reads the firmware image provided by ACPI 5.0 from `/sys/firmware/acpi/bgrt/*` and displays it on the
  framebuffer at the same position (`xoffset`, `yoffset`).
  - afaik, UEFI needs to be enabled. probably quick boot, and full resolution booting too.
- then waits for the user to enter its password, and writes it to a file.
- look in `arch/` to see how to integrate with archlinux's initcpio system.


## Why not plymouth

- Yes, [Plymouth](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Plymouth/) is probably the better solution. It has much
  more features and is much better tested.
- For example, plymouth stays in control for the whole boot process, and gives out control only before X11/lgoin manager takes over. This program instead, leaves the console in static graphic mode with the image, making it fairly useless.
- This is just a very simple experiment.


# TODO

- some kind of password prompt, and some feedback
- see how to integrate with Dracut and/or other distros
- probably by using the [keyring interface](https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/blob/master/docs/Keyring.txt)
